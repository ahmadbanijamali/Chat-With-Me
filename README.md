# "Chat With Me" Chrome Extension

## Overview
The "Chat With Me" Chrome Extension is a simple browser extension that allows users to interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's API, using LLM. Users can send messages, receive responses, start new chat sessions, and manage chat history.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Interface**: A popup HTML page (`popup.html`) that includes:
   - A container to display chat sessions.
   - A container to display the chat conversation.
   - An input field for user messages.
   - Buttons for sending messages, starting new chats, and clearing chat history.

2. **Chat Interaction**:
   - User is asked to add the OpenAI API key the first time that the extension is run.
   - Users should be able to type messages and view bot responses within the chat container.
   - The chat interface should differentiate between user messages and bot responses with distinct styles.

3. **Session Management**:
   - The extension should save chat sessions persistently using Chrome's `storage` API.
   - Users should be able to view a list of saved chat sessions and select one to view its content.
   - Users should have the option to start a new chat session, which saves the current session and clears the chat container.
   - Users should have the option to clear all chat history after a confirmation prompt.

4. **OpenAI API Integration**:
   - The extension must be able to send user messages to the OpenAI API and display the bot's responses.
   - The extension should handle API authentication by storing and retrieving the OpenAI API key using Chrome's `storage` API.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The extension should display an error message if communication with the OpenAI API fails.
   - The extension should prompt the user to enter their OpenAI API key if it's not already stored.

## Technical Requirements

1. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The extension must be implemented using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Chrome Extension API**: The extension must use the Chrome Extension API to interact with browser features, such as `storage` and `scripting`.

3. **OpenAI API**: The extension must integrate with the OpenAI API, requiring the `host_permissions` to be set for `https://api.openai.com/*`.

4. **Styling**: The extension should use a `styles.css` file to define the look and feel of the chat interface, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

5. **Manifest File**: The extension must include a `manifest.json` file with the necessary metadata, permissions, and settings for a Chrome Extension.

## Security Requirements

1. **API Key Storage**: The OpenAI API key should be stored securely using Chrome's `storage.sync` API.

2. **Input Validation**: User input should be properly sanitized before being sent to the OpenAI API to prevent injection attacks.

## Testing Requirements

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify that all user interactions work as expected, including message sending, session management, and error handling.

2. **Performance Testing**: Ensure that the extension performs well, with no significant delays in message sending or session loading.

3. **Security Testing**: Test for potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in the storage and handling of the OpenAI API key.

## Deployment Requirements

1. **Packaging**: The extension should be packaged as a ZIP file containing all necessary files for distribution.

2. **Installation Instructions**: Provide clear instructions for installing the extension in Chrome, including how to load an unpacked extension for development and testing.

3. **User Documentation**: Include a user guide explaining how to use the extension, manage chat sessions, and configure the OpenAI API key.

## Support and Maintenance

1. **Issue Tracking**: Implement a system for users to report bugs or suggest enhancements.

2. **Updates**: Plan for periodic updates to the extension to address user feedback, add new features, and maintain compatibility with Chrome and the OpenAI API.
